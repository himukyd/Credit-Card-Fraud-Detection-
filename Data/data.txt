Dataset Information

This project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset available on Kaggle.

The dataset contains real transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
It includes 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are frauds — representing only 0.172% of all transactions.
 This extreme class imbalance makes it an ideal dataset for testing anomaly detection and imbalanced classification techniques.

Due to GitHub’s file size limitation (maximum 100 MB per file), 
the original dataset (≈150 MB) cannot be uploaded directly to this repository.
